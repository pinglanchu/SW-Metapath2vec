The processing of ACM and DBLP data mainly references the [HAN](https://github.com/Jhy1993/HAN), while the heterogeneous complex network for Last.FM was constructed using DGL. 

Preprocessed ACM can be found in: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1V2iOikRqHPtVvaANdkzROw 提取码：50k2

Preprocessed DBLP can be found in: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Qr2e97MofXsBhUvQqgJqDg 提取码：6b3h

Original Last.FM can be found in: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1-iBEr_XO-_z_6Lhg8nQdBg 提取码: aq7m

The benchmark algorithms are based on [HAN](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/tree/master/examples/pytorch/han), [RGCN](https://github.com/JinheonBaek/RGCN), [GAT](https://github.com/PetarV-/GAT), [GraphSage](https://github.com/williamleif/GraphSAGE).
